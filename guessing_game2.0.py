"----------------------------- FINAL COMMENTS ------------------------------------"

'''
This is my tempoary final edit on this game. Later in the future i may add a random functionality where the questions is
gotten from a website at random and the score can be saved in a file so if the user's previous score was better, it would
say so. Also i would build like a gui for this game because this is quite old fashioned.
